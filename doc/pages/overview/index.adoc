https://github.com/liquidz/elin[Elin] is a Clojure development environment, primarily written in https://babashka.org[Babashka].

This project is being developed as the successor to {vim-iced} and, as same as vim-iced, is heavily inspired by {CIDER}.

The goal of this project is to provide a server program that serves as the foundation for a Clojure development environment and its interface, enabling it to theoretically offer a Clojure development environment to any editor.

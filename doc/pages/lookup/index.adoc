There are some commands to lookup the documentation of the symbol under the cursor.

[%autowidth,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Command | Default key mapping | Description

| <<ElinLookup>>
| `{ElinLookup-default-mapping}`
| Lookup docstring

| <<ElinShowSource>>
| `{ElinShowSource-default-mapping}`
| Lookup source code

| <<ElinShowClojureDocs>>
| `{ElinShowClojureDocs-default-mapping}`
| Lookup https://clojuredocs.org/[ClojureDocs]

|===

=== Lookup results

By default, the results of <<ElinLookup>> and <<ElinShowSource>> are shown in a <<_interceptor_handlershow_result_as_popup,popup>>,
and  the results of <<ElinShowClojureDocs>> are shown in <<_interceptor_handlerappend_result_to_info_buffer,information buffer and temporal buffer>>.

The result format is defined by configuration file as a https://mustache.github.io[mustache] format.

=== Lookup order

In Elin, there are three types of var lookups: `nrepl`, `clj-kondo`, and `local`.

[%autowidth,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Lookup type | Description

| `nrepl`
| Looking up vars based on information from the nREPL server. Even if a var is not saved in a file, it can still be referenced if it has been evaluated.

| `clj-kondo`
| Looking up vars based on clj-kondo's analysis results. If a var is not saved in a file and is not reflected in the analysis results, it cannot be referenced.

| `local`
| Looking up local vars bound with `let`, etc., based on clj-kondo's analysis results. If a var is not saved in a file and is not reflected in the analysis results, it cannot be referenced.
|===

Each handler has different reference targets and priorities, which can be customized in the configuration file.

[%autowidth,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Command | Default order | Description

| <<ElinLookup>>
| `nrepl`, `clj-kondo`
| `local` is not included in the order because it is not necessary to look up the documentation.

| <<ElinShowSource>>
| `local`, `nrepl`, `clj-kondo`
| `local` is prioritized because we'd like to see the local definition first.

| <<ElinShowClojureDocs>>
| `nrepl`, `clj-kondo`
| `local` is not included in the order because it is not necessary to look up clojuredocs.

=== Temporal buffer

This buffer temporarily displays content that is newly recorded in the <<Information buffer>> when the <<Information buffer>> is not currently visible.
It is used, for example, to display <<Testing,test results>> or <<Macro,macro expansion results>>.

This buffer automatically closes when the <<Information buffer>> is displayed.

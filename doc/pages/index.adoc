== Overview

https://github.com/liquidz/elin[elin] is a Clojure development environment, primarily written in https://babashka.org[Babashka].

This project is being developed as the successor to {vim-iced} and, as same as vim-iced, is heavily inspired by {CIDER}.

The goal of this project is to provide a server program that serves as the foundation for a Clojure development environment and its interface, enabling it to theoretically offer a Clojure development environment to any editor.

== Getting Started

include::./getting_started/index.adoc[]

== Evaluation

TODO

== Completion

TODO

== Formatting

Elin does not provide a default formatter for now.
The reason is that for format checks in CI, external tools such as {cljfmt}, {cljstyle}, or {clojure-lsp} are commonly used, and a formatter that only works within the editor is often unnecessary.

However, if you blocked when saving files in namespaces with large amounts of code due to the formatting entire buffer, you can use the {elin-format} plugin to format only the current form.

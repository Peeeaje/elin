Elin only supports {shadow-cljs} for now.

=== shadow-cljs

To start CLJS REPL with shadow-cljs, you need following steps.

. Start to watch
** `$ npx shadow-cljs watch YOUR-BUILD-ID`
. Access shadow-cljs’s HTTP server in your browser
** E.g. http://localhost:8080
. Connect to the nREPL
** Execute <<ElinConnect>> command to connect to the nREPL.
** For shadow-cljs, cljs-repl will be started automatically after connection.
** You don’t need to specify your build ID anymore.

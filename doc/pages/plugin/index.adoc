=== Your plugin

For Vim/Neovim, it searches for `elin/plugin.edn` in the runtime path and handle the directory containing the `plugin.edn` file as a plugin.

.elin/plugin.edn
[source,clojure]
----
{:name "YOUR PLUGIN NAME"

 ;; OPTIONAL: Your plugin configuration
 :export {:handler { ... }
          :interceptor { ... }}}
----

The Elin server adds to the classpath the directory containing `plugin.edn` and <<Server configuration files,applies the configurations>> defined under the `:export` key in `plugin.edn`.
If `:export` is not defined, the Elin server only adds the directory to the classpath and takes no further action.

For the actual processing, please refer to the code for handlers/interceptors in the Elin core or existing plugins.

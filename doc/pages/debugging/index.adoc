=== Macro
Expanding macro is important for writing/debugging macros. Elin provides following commands.

[%autowidth,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Command | Default key mapping

| <<ElinMacroExpand1CurrentList>>
| `{elin-handler-evaluate-expand-1-current-list}`
|===

Expanding results are shown in the <<Temporal buffer>> and <<Information buffer>>.


=== #dbg and #break

Elin supports CIDERâ€™s `#dbg` and `#break` reader literals.
The easiest way is to put `#dbg` to your code, and evaluate it.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn fib [n]
  #dbg (loop [a 0 b 1 n n]
         (if (<= n 0)
           a
           (recur b (+ a b) (dec n)))))
----

Once you evaluate `(fib 10)`, debugger will launch.

This feature is implemented by the <<_interceptor_debugprocess_debugger>> interceptor.

=== Tapped values

In elin, values tapped with https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/tap%3E[tap>] are displayed in the <<Information buffer>>, regardless of where they were tapped, and can be used as a substitute for debug prints.
Compared to debug prints like `println`, the advantage of using `tap>` is that you can inspect the tapped values in detail later.

Specifically, in elin, the value `tap>` is applied to can be referenced from an elin-specific var named `*tapped*` by default.
This allows you to use `tap>` as a substitute for a debug print, letting you refer to the value as needed.

[source,clojure]
----
(tap> [:random-uuid (random-uuid)])
;; => true

(-> *tapped* first)
;; => {:id "0f307a48-82ff-4a31-80b9-9c67ff856464", :time "2112-09-03T11:22:33.123456", :value [:random-uuid #uuid "0d3a1159-5563-4530-8fe8-ae07768395c5"]}

(-> *tapped* first :value second)
;; => #uuid "0d3a1159-5563-4530-8fe8-ae07768395c5"
----

This var name is defined in <<_interceptor_tapaccess_tapped_values>> interceptor and can be freely <<_server_configuration_files,changed>>.


[source,clojure]
----
{:interceptor {:config-map {elin.interceptor.tap/access-tapped-values {:var-name "foobar"}}}}

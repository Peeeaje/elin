=== Macro
Expanding macro is important for writing/debugging macros. Elin provides following commands.

[%autowidth,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Command | Default key mapping

| <<ElinMacroExpand1CurrentList>>

|===

Expanding results are shown in the <<Temporal buffer>> and <<Information buffer>>.


=== #dbg and #break

Elin supports CIDERâ€™s `#dbg` and `#break` reader literals.
The easiest way is to put `#dbg` to your code, and evaluate it.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn fib [n]
  #dbg (loop [a 0 b 1 n n]
         (if (<= n 0)
           a
           (recur b (+ a b) (dec n)))))
----

Once you evaluate `(fib 10)`, debugger will launch.

This feature is implemented by the <<_interceptor_debugprocess_debugger>> interceptor.

= Development

== Server

* `bb repl` command starts development server and nREPL server.
** By default, it starts development server for Neovim.
** You can specify other editor by `:host` option.
*** e.g. `bb repl :host vim` for Vim.

* To connect the nREPL server, execute `call elin#notify('elin.handler.connect/connect', [])`.

* Evaluating `(elin.dev/go)` will restart the development server.
** When the server is restarted, the connection to the nREPL server is disconnected, so you need to reconnect.


== Type checking

* Type checking with https://github.com/metosin/malli[malli] is enabled by default.
